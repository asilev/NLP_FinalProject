# Hebrew Short Message Stylometry
The goal for this project is to research and present a method for hebrew short messages stylometry.
The system that should be implemented should be able to identify an author of a message based on previously learned authoring style.
The goal is to study the features required for such identification, when working on short messages in Hebrew language.
